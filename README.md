# Data for Wraithdale

The data files should be in yaml format, matching the existing format
I have added for the first few files with comments (after #) to try and
explain the format.  All of the -'s and alignment with tabs is important,
best bet will be to copy an existing item and paste at the bottom.

Please check the format of the data using [yaml lint](http://yamllint.com/) 
or [yaml parser](http://yaml-online-parser.appspot.com/).

*NOTE:* Be careful to use the unit name properly for upgrades (don't switch from singular to plural)

Once you complete your change "check that change in" using the following commands in the Terminal window at the bottom.

    git add .
    git commit -m 'I added something'

Thanks for helping!
