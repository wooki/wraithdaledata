# Data for Wraithdale

The data files should be in json format, matching the existing format
I have added for the first few files.

Please check the format of the data using [jsonlint](http://jsonlint.com/) or [json visualization](http://chris.photobooks.com/json/default.htm).

Once you complete your change "check that change in" using the following commands in the Terminal window at the bottom.

    git add .
    git commit -m 'I added something'

Thanks for helping!
